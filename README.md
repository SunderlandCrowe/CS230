Module 8 Journal Entry

The Gaming Room was a company that wanted to implement its already built web application "Draw it or Lose it" across a multitude of platforms in order to draw in more users. 

In developing the documentation for the planned software I would say figuinring out what OS would be optimal for the desired outcome of the game was something I do particularly well. I looked into the architecture and compatibility of each OS and figured out which one would be the best for compatibility. 

When working through a design document I found that keeping track of revisions helped in keeping the process organized and allowed for a better workflow.

If I could go back an revise this document I think I would want to attempt to implement the application through linux instead of Windows to see the differences between each OS and better understand Kernel.

The user's needs were not so demanding that they needed to have traditonal servers and in fact fit more into cloud based operations. Understanding the needs of the user allows for efficient use of resources and cuts down on cost for both the client and the company providing the service. 

In designing software UML Diagrams certainly help in making sure each part of the application is where it is supposed to be. Along with that this Software Documentation sheet is very help in prepping for the initial build of the sotware and helps avoid any bumps later down the road if the proper research is taken place ot ensure that the right tools are being utilized in order to fulfill the clients request.
